#### 7/16

* Spent Monday setting up React App, Node.js on desktop, linking local repo to GitHub repo.

* Worked Wednesday to get a grasp on SVG paths and react-particles-js. When using their example deer image it produced a clean image, but my first attempts at svg paths did not work out as expected

* Thankfully, after ruminating on the issue all day at work on Thursday, I was able to sit down and model this much more successful sunset type sun shape.
